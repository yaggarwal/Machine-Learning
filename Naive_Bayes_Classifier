- Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm

- Some other classification techniques are 
   -- K nearest means
   -- Support Vector machines
   -- Artifical neural networks
   
Examples:  - Email is spam or ham
           - Identify Fraud credit card transtcions   -- to classify each transaction is a fraud or not
           
           
 Steps:  With any classification problems
 1. You first need to identify FEATURES. Examples:  Amount Spent, IP address, Failed attempts in making transaction, location, time since last transaction etc
    Each transaction would be represented as list of these FEATURE VECTORS
    
    - Each of these is a variable whose value can not be determined beforehand. However the range or set of values these variables can take is determined.
    - These above variables are called RANDOM VARIABLES. We don't know what values these variables can take but we know a set of values from which these 
      variables can take values.
    
    - Random variables are of 3 tyes --- DISCRETE -  can take only integer values - [-1, -2, 0, 2, 1]
                                         CONTINOUS  - can take any value in the range of values. e.g..can take any value between 0-1 or 0 - infinity
                                         CATEGORICAL - can take one of a fixed set of values. These are called categories. eg: [red, blue, yellow]. Value of 
                                                        random variable can take any one from these values.
                                                        
    - PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION -  is a table where we list the probablity of outcome of each value a random variable can take.
    - UNIFORM PROBABLITY DISTRIBUTION -  is a probabity distribution with a constant or same values for all the variables. Example: Tossing a die
       Will have same probablity 1/6 for each of the random variable (1 to 6)
     
     
 2. Check what distributions each of these feature or random variables follows. Because many of the machine learning techniques make an assumption
    that random variable follows Normal Distribution. So always check for the normality if an algorithm makes such an assumption.
    
    Example:  Suppose a measurement experiment in physics lab. Mesuring the diamter of ball bearings. You measure the diameter several time and then take
              the average.
              Takinga measure each time is called statistical experiment. 
              In Most the cases, values will tend to fall to the same value i.e mean value and the values which varies from the means are called 
              Standard Devaitions.
